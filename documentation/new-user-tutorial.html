        <h1>Tutorial for New Users</h1>
        <p>Here you will find a step by step guide to downloading, configuring,
        and running the Einstein Toolkit. The tutorial uses an web-based
        interface using jupyter notebooks, so no software needs to be installed
        on your own computer. If you find something that does not work, please
        email
        <a href="mailto:users@einsteintoolkit.org">users@einsteintoolkit.org</a>.
        <em>Advanced topic</em>
        If, instead of using the web-based service, you would rather like to
        run the tutorial on your own laptop, then please use <a
        href="LocalCactusTutorial.ipynb">this</a> <em>RH: this does not work,
        we need to provide the notebook in a nbviewer or similar to provide
        instructions on how to install jupyter or ipython-notebook)</em>
        notebook instead.
        </p>
        <h2>Getting an account</h2>
        <p>Before you can get started you will require and account on the tutorial
        server, which is hosted by the <a href="http://www.nationaldataservice.org/">National Data Service</a>.
        Please go to
        <a href="https://www.einsteintoolkit.nationaldataservice.org">https://www.einsteintoolkit.nationaldataservice.org</a>
        and click on "Request Access".<br>
        <img class="img-responsive" src="../images/new-users-tutorial/01-request-access.png">
        <br>
        Fill out the "Request Access" form and click "Request Access" once more
        <br>
        <img class="img-responsive" src="../images/new-users-tutorial/02-access-request-form.png">
        <br>
        which will ask you to confirm your email address:<br>
        <img class="img-responsive" src="../images/new-users-tutorial/03-wait-for-email-confirmation.png">.
        <br>
        Once your email is confirmed an adminstrator has to accept your access
        request, please allow for 1 <em>business</em> day for this to happen.
        Once the account is approved you will receive an email from "Labs
        Workbench Support" with subject "Account approved".</br>
        <em>NOTE</em> Accounts (and the data in them) will be deleted after NN
        months of inactivity. Please make sure to download your data before that.
        <em>RH: right now there is no option for them to download a directory
        as a zip file. This should be added. I think such an option was present
        in the tutorial files that Steve and Peter had used for the workshop
        files.</em>
        </p>
        <h2>Starting the jupyter notebook</h2>
        Once you account is approved, go back to 
        <a href="https://www.einsteintoolkit.nationaldataservice.org">https://www.einsteintoolkit.nationaldataservice.org</a>
        this time clicking on "Sign in here" or use the link in the approval
        email both of which will bring you to the login page.<br>
        <img class="img-responsive" src="../images/new-users-tutorial/04-login.png">.
        <br>
        Once logged in you will see the list of avaialble applications<br>
        <img class="img-responsive" src="../images/new-users-tutorial/05-select-image.png">.
        <br>
        where you should click on "Add" for the "Jupyter/Einstein Toolkit"
        application. This will add the application to your account and bring
        you to a page listing all of your applications.
        </p>
        <p>At this point the application has not been started yet ("Stopped" in
        the first column of the table) and you must click on "Launch" to start
        it. Please do so now.<br>
        <img class="img-responsive" src="../images/new-users-tutorial/06-start-image.png">
        <br>
        While the image is starting the screen will turn yellow and a spinning
        icon will be shown. Please be patient, since starting up the
        application can take several minutes.<br>
        <img class="img-responsive" src="../images/new-users-tutorial/07-image-starting.png">
        <br>
        Once the application has fully started up, the screen will turn green
        and a small icon appears next to "Jupyter/Einstein Toolkit" in the
        second column. Click on in now to go to the jupyter notebook server.
        <br>
        <img class="img-responsive" src="../images/new-users-tutorial/08-image-ready.png">
        <br>
        You will be presented with a view of the directories avaialbe inside of
        the application, which in this case is just a single directory called
        "work".<br>
        <img class="img-responsive" src="../images/new-users-tutorial/09-initial-directory.png">
        <br>
        Please navigate inside of the "work" directory by clicking on it, which
        will show its content, which is a single file "CactusTutorial.ipynb".
        <br>
        <img class="img-responsive" src="../images/new-users-tutorial/10-tutorial-ipynb.png">
        <br>
        Click on the file and you will be brought to the actual jupyter
        notebook. From this point on, please follow the instructions in the
        notebook.  <br>
