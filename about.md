__The Einstein Toolkit is a [community](members.html)-driven software platform
of core computational tools to advance and support research in relativistic
astrophysics and gravitational physics.__

We are developing and supporting open software for relativistic astrophysics.
Our aim is to provide the core computational tools that can enable new science,
broaden our community, facilitate interdisciplinary research and take advantage
of emerging petascale computers and advanced cyberinfrastructure.

The Einstein Toolkit aims to include any computational tool the fits into it's
scope. Currently, a large portion of the toolkit is made up by over 100
[Cactus](http://www.cactuscode.org) components (called thorns) for
computational relativity along with associated tools for simulation management
and visualization. This includes a vacuum spacetime solver (McLachlan), two
relativistic hydrodynamics solvers (GRHydro and IllinoisGRMHD), along with
components for initial data, analysis and computational infrastructure. These
components have been developed and improved over many years by [many different
researchers](maintainers-credits.html).

The Einstein Toolkit is supported by a distributed model, combining core
support of software, tools, and documentation with partnerships with other
developers who contribute open software and coordinate together on development.

The tools and thorns comprising the Einstein Toolkit are provided in this
[Component List](https://bitbucket.org/einsteintoolkit/manifest/raw/ET_2016_11/einsteintoolkit.th).
A [tutorial](http://docs.einsteintoolkit.org/et-docs/Tutorial_for_New_Users)
describes in easy steps how to download, compile, and run this resoluting code.
