          <p><b>The Einstein Toolkit is a <a href="members.html">community</a>-driven software platform of core computational tools to advance and support research in relativistic astrophysics and gravitational
          physics.</b></p>
          <p>This means:</p>
          <p>We are developing and supporting open software for relativistic astrophysics. Our aim is to provide the core computational tools that can enable new science, broaden our
          community, facilitate interdisciplinary research and take advantage of emerging petascale computers and advanced cyberinfrastructure.</p>
          <p>The Einstein Toolkit aims to include any computational tool the fits into it's scope. Currently, a large portion of the toolkit is made up by over 100 <a href=
          "http://www.cactuscode.org">Cactus</a> components (called thorns) for computational relativity along with associated tools for simulation management and visualization. This
          includes a vacuum spacetime solver (McLachlan), two relativistic hydrodynamics solvers (GRHydro and IllinoisGRMHD), along with components for initial data, analysis and
          computational infrastructure. These components have been developed and improved over many years by <a href="maintainers-credits.html">many different researchers</a>.</p>
          <p>The Einstein Toolkit is supported by a distributed model, combining core support of software, tools, and documentation with partnerships with other developers who
          contribute open software and coordinate together on development.</p>
          <p>The tools and thorns comprising the Einstein Toolkit are provided in this <a href=
          "https://bitbucket.org/einsteintoolkit/manifest/raw/ET_2016_11/einsteintoolkit.th">Component List</a>. A <a href=
          "http://docs.einsteintoolkit.org/et-docs/Tutorial_for_New_Users">tutorial</a> describes in easy steps how to download, compile, and run this resoluting code.</p>

          <h2>Vacuum Spacetimes</h2>
          <p>Evolution of vacuum spacetime is provided by the McLachlan code. McLachlan solves the Einstein vacuum equations in 3D Cartesian coordinates using adaptive mesh refinement
          and can be combined with matter codes for modeling spacetimes containing matter. McLachlan is implemented using the Kranc package. Features of McLachlan include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>complete implementation of the BSSNOK general relativity spacetime evolution equations including all the standard tricks that ensures stability</li>
            <li>up-winding for the shift advection terms</li>
            <li>standard moving puncture Gamma-driver and 1 + log gauges</li>
            <li>phi- and W- methods</li>
            <li>static and radiative outer boundary conditions</li>
            <li>inclusion of matter through the TmunuBase interface</li>
            <li>up to 8th order finite differencing</li>
            <li>OpenMP parallelization through Carpet/LoopControl in addition to MPI parallelization through Carpet</li>
            <li>multi-block code infrastructures by applying the Jacobian to transform local derivatives to global derivatives</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 style="word-wrap: break-word;"><b>Relativistic Magneto&#8203;hydrodynamics</b></h2>
          <h3>GRHydro</h3>
          <p>The Einstein Toolkit GRHydro modules can evolve spacetimes with general relativistic hydrodynamics in 3D Cartesian coordinates. GRHydro was once based on the public
          version of the <a href="http://www.whiskycode.org/">Whisky code</a> developed originally by the EU Network on Sources of Gravitational Radiation and later by a collaboration
          led by AEI/SISSA, but was later expanded and cleaned up considerably. Features of GRHydro include at the moment:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Evolution of the equations of general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamics (GRMHD) in 3D Cartesian coordinates on a curved dynamical background.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>IllinoisGRMHD</h3>
          <p>IllinoisGRMHD solves the equations of General Relativistic MagnetoHydroDynamics (GRMHD) using a high-resolution shock capturing scheme. It is a rewrite of the Illinois
          Numerical Relativity (ILNR) group's GRMHD code, and generates results that agree to roundoff error with that original code. Its feature set coincides with the features of the
          ILNR group's recent code (ca. 2009--2014), which was used in their modeling of the following systems:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Magnetized circumbinary disk accretion onto binary black holes</li>
            <li>Magnetized black hole--neutron star mergers</li>
            <li>Magnetized Bondi flow, Bondi-Hoyle-Littleton accretion</li>
            <li>White dwarf--neutron star mergers</li>
          </ul>
          <p>IllinoisGRMHD is particularly good at modeling GRMHD flows into black holes without the need for excision. Its HARM-based conservative-to-primitive solver has also been
          modified to check the physicality of conservative variables prior to primitive inversion, and move them into the physical range if they become unphysical.</p>
          <h2>Initial Data</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Single and binary black holes</li>

             <p>The Einstein Toolkit is a collection of software components and tools for simulating and analyzing general relativistic astrophysical systems. Such systems include
        gravitational wave space-times, collisions of compact objects such as black holes or neutron stars, accretion onto compact objects, core collapse supernovae and Gamma-Ray
        Bursts.</p>
        <p>The Einstein Toolkit builds on numerous software efforts in the numerical relativity community including CactusEinstein, <a href="http://www.whiskycode.org/">Whisky</a>,
        and <a href="http://www.carpetcode.org">Carpet</a>. The Einstein Toolkit currently uses the <a href="http://www.cactuscode.org">Cactus Framework</a> as the underlying
        computational infrastructure that provides large-scale parallelization, general computational components, and a model for collaborative, portable code development.</p>
        <p><b>Guiding principles for the design and implementation of the toolkit include:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li><i><b>Open, community-driven software development</b> that encourages the sharing of code across the community, prevents code duplication and leads to sustainable support
          and development of essential code.</i></li>
          <li><i><b>Well thought out and stable interfaces</b> between components that enable multiple implementations of physics capabilities, and allow groups or individuals to
          concentrate on their areas of interest.</i></li>
          <li><i><b>Separation of physics software from computational science infrastructure</b> so that new technologies for large scale computing, processor accelerators, or parallel
          I/O can be easily integrated with science codes.</i></li>
          <li><i>The provision of <b>complete working production codes</b> to provide: prototypes, standard benchmarks and testcases; codes that are available for and usable by the
          general astrophysics community; tools for new researchers and groups to enter this field; training and education for a new generation of researchers.</i></li>
        </ul><br>
        <div>
          <p>The Toolkit includes a set of mix-and-match components (or Thorns) that support the development of codes for relativistic astrophysics. A number of full examples provide
          prototype, production examples of complete astrophysical codes including black hole spacetimes and relativistic hydrodynamical spacetimes.</p>
          <p>The Einstein Toolkit uses a distributed model with its software modules either developed, distributed and supported by the <a href="maintainers-credits.html">core maintainers</a> team, or by
          individual groups. Where modules are provided by external groups, we provide quality control for modules for inclusion in the toolkit and help coordinate support.</p>
          <p>Through this effort we want to catalyze a consortium for the development and support for community infrastucture for relativistic astrophysics. Although currently the
          toolkit is based on Cactus, in the future we plan for the consortium to support other relevant community codes. In the shorter term we are building on the toolkit and
          interested in tools that interface with Cactus for initial data, post-processing and visualization.</p>
          <!--<p>The development of the Einstein Toolkit is funded through awards NSF 0701566 & 0653303 (XiRel), NSF 0903973, 0903973 & 0903782 (CIGR), NSF 0905046/0941653 (PetaCactus/PRAC). Additional support for Cactus and Carpet is provided through NSF 0721915 (Alpaca) and funding from the Center for Computation & Technology at LSU.</p>-->
