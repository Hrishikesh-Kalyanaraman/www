        <p><b>The Einstein Toolkit is a <a href="members.html">community</a>-driven software platform of core computational tools to advance and support research in relativistic astrophysics and gravitational physics.</b></p>
        <p>We are developing and supporting open software for relativistic astrophysics. Our aim is to provide the core computational tools that can enable new science, broaden our
        community, facilitate interdisciplinary research and take advantage of emerging petascale computers and advanced cyberinfrastructure.</p>
        <p>The Einstein Toolkit aims to include any computational tool the fits into it's scope. Currently, a large portion of the toolkit is made up by over 100 <a href=
        "http://www.cactuscode.org">Cactus</a> components (called thorns) for computational relativity along with associated tools for simulation management and visualization. This
        includes two vacuum spacetime solvers (McLachlan, Lean), two relativistic hydrodynamics solvers (GRHydro and IllinoisGRMHD), along with components for initial data, analysis and
        computational infrastructure. These components have been developed and improved over many years by many different researchers.</p>
        <p>The Einstein Toolkit is supported by a distributed model, combining core support of software, tools, and documentation with partnerships with other developers who
        contribute open software and coordinate together on development.</p>
        <p>The tools and thorns comprising the Einstein Toolkit are provided in this <a href=
        "https://bitbucket.org/einsteintoolkit/manifest/raw/ET_2019_10/einsteintoolkit.th">Component List</a>. A <a href=
        "documentation/new-user-tutorial">tutorial</a> describes in easy steps how to compile the Einstein Toolkit, and run a short simulations.</p>
