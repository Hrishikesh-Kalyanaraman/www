<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
After months of work, I am pleased to release my rewrite of the Illinois
numerical relativity group's staggered A-field GRMHD thorn to the ET
community. The new thorn is called IllinoisGRMHD, and yields results
identical (within roundoff error) to the original GRMHD code of the
Illinois group with AMR &amp; unigrids, with bitant symmetry &amp; without, and
with single or multiple MPI processes. We used precisely these GRMHD
algorithms to produce our latest GRMHD-based papers.

IllinoisGRMHD is written entirely in C, except for some C++ file I/O for
debugging purposes, and all loops are OpenMP-compatible. The coding
standard is C99.

I would like to thank Frank and the CCT folks, who have graciously agreed
to host IllinoisGRMHD on the ET SVN server, as the thorn awaits
maintainers' approval for incorporation into the official ET.

Download IllinoisGRMHD via the following command:
<pre>
svn co https://svn.einsteintoolkit.org/cactus/EinsteinEvolve/IllinoisGRMHD/trunk/
</pre>

<a href="https://svn.einsteintoolkit.org/cactus/EinsteinEvolve/IllinoisGRMHD/trunk/">Browse</a> IllinoisGRMHD source code in your web browser.
</p>

<h4>Background</h4>
<p>
Roughly a decade of work has gone into the original code, and nearly all of
the credit for debugging that battle-hardened code goes to Stu Shapiro and
other former &amp; current members of his group, to whom I give my great thanks
and send the following message: Despite weeks entirely devoted to debugging
this rewritten code, I found no major bugs in the original code.
</p>

<h4>License</h4>
<p>
The IllinoisGRMHD thorn is hereby released under the GNU GPL v2 or higher,
to maximize compatibility with the ET thorns.

Numerical Relativity Group Research interests: My research interests span all
of computational astrophysics. Much of my past work has focused on simulating
the mergers of compact binary systems, including BHNS, BHBH, WDNS, and NSNS. My
current work focuses on BHBH mergers, as well as studying MHD effects in BHNS
mergers.
