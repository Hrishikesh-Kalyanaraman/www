        <h2>Release Announcement</h2>


        <p>We are pleased to announce the fifth release (code name "<a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace">Lovelace</a>") of the Einstein Toolkit, an
        open, community developed software infrastructure for relativistic astrophysics. This
        release includes beginning support for OpenCL (disabled by default). In addition, bug fixes
        accumulated since the previous release in October 2011 have been included.</p>


        <p>The Einstein Toolkit is a collection of software components and tools for simulating and
        analyzing general relativistic astrophysical systems that builds on numerous software
        efforts in the numerical relativity community including CactusEinstein, the Carpet AMR
        infrastructure and the relativistic hydrodynamics code GRHydro (an updated and extended
        version of the public release of the Whisky code). The Cactus Framework is used as the
        underlying computational infrastructure providing large-scale parallelization, general
        computational components, and a model for collaborative, portable code development. The
        toolkit includes modules to build complete codes for simulating black hole spacetimes as
        well as systems governed by relativistic hydrodynamics.</p>


        <p>The Einstein Toolkit uses a distributed software model and its different modules are
        developed, distributed, and supported either by the core team of Einstein Toolkit
        Maintainers, or by individual groups. Where modules are provided by external groups, the
        Einstein Toolkit Maintainers provide quality control for modules for inclusion in the
        toolkit and help coordinate support. The Einstein Toolkit Maintainers currently involve
        postdocs and faculty from five different institutions, and host weekly meetings that are
        open for anyone to join in.</p>


        <p>Guiding principles for the design and implementation of the toolkit include: open,
        community-driven software development; well thought out and stable interfaces; separation
        of physics software from computational science infrastructure; provision of complete
        working production code; training and education for a new generation of researchers.</p>


        <p>For more information about using or contributing to the Einstein Toolkit, or to join the
        Einstein Toolkit Consortium, please visit our web pages at &lt;<a href=
        "http://einsteintoolkit.org">http://einsteintoolkit.org</a>&gt;.</p>


        <p>The Einstein Toolkit is primarily supported by NSF 0903973/0903782/0904015 (CIGR), and
        also by NSF 0701566/0855892 (XiRel), 0721915 (Alpaca), 0905046/0941653 (PetaCactus), and
        0710874 (LONI Grid).</p>


        <p>The Einstein Toolkit contain over 170 regression test cases. On a large portion of the
        tested machines, all of these testsuites <a href=
        "http://einsteintoolkit.org/release-info/ET_2012_05/parse_testsuite_results.php">pass</a>,
        using both MPI and OpenMP parallelisation.</p>


        <h4>The changes between this and the previous release include:</h4>


        <p>
        </p>


        <ul>
          <li>Accelerator Support</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>

        <p>This release of the Einstein Toolkit adds support for GPUs and other accelerators. This
        support comprises three levels of abstraction, ranging from merely building and running
        both CUDA and OpenCL code, to automated code generation targeting GPUs instead of CPUs. As
        with any other programming paradigm (such as MPI or OpenMP), the performance benefits
        depend on the particular algorithms used and optimizations that are applied. In addition,
        the Simulation Factory greatly aids portability to a wide range of computing systems.</p>


        <p>At the lowest level, Cactus now supports compiling, building, and running with either
        CUDA or OpenCL. CUDA is supported as new language in addition to C, C++, and Fortran;
        OpenCL is supported as an external library, and builds and executes compute kernels via
        run-time calls. Details are described in the user's guide (for CUDA) and in thorn
        ExternalLibraries/OpenCL (for OpenCL).</p>


        <p>Many accelerator platforms today separate between host memory and device memory, and
        require explicit copy or map operations to transfer data. An intermediate level of
        abstraction aids transferring grid variables between host and device, using schedule
        declarations to keep track of which data are needed where, and minimizing expensive data
        transfers. For OpenCL, there is a compact API to build and execute compute kernels at run
        time. Details are described in thorns CactusUtils/Accelerator and CactusUtils/OpenCLRunTime
        (with example parameter file).</p>


        <p>Finally, the code generation system Kranc has been extended to be able to produce either
        C++ or OpenCL code, based on the infrastructure described above. This allows writing GPU
        code in a very high-level manner. However, it needs to be stated that the efficiency of the
        generated code depends on many variables, including e.g. the finite differencing stencil
        radius and the number of operations in the generated compute kernels. Non-trivial kernels
        typically require system-dependent tuning to execute efficiently, as GPUs and other
        accelerators generally show a rather unforgiving performance behavior. The thorns
        McLachlan/ML_WaveToy and McLachlan/ML_WaveToy_CL are examples, generated from the same
        Kranc script, showing the generated C++ and OpenCL code.</p>

        <h4>How to upgrade from ET_2011_10 (Maxwell)</h4>


        <p>To upgrade from the previous release, use GetComponents with the new thornlist to check
        out the new version. GetComponents can also be used to update an existing checkout, but
        since some components might have changed location or have been removed from the toolkit you
        should try a new checkout whenever possible instead.</p>


        <p>See the <a href="http://einsteintoolkit.org/download/">Download</a> page on the Einstein
        Toolkit website for download instructions.</p>


        <h4>Remaining issues with this release</h4>


        <p>
        </p>


        <ul>
          <li>Certain machines need to be configured specially in Simfactory because the remote
          directories cannot be determined automatically just from the username. See the Machine
          notes below.</li>


          <li>CarpetIOHDF5: When the new parameter CarpetIOHDF5::output_symmetry_points is set to
          "yes", then symmetry points are not actually output if CarpetIOHDF5::output_buffer_points
          has been set to "no".</li>


          <li>Recovering with Carpet: The maximum number of timelevels that can be recovered is
          Carpet::prolongation_order_time+1. This is usually the case, but it is possible to write
          parameter files e.g. with prolongation_order_time=1 that use 3 timelevels. This bug
          manifests in an assert() failure when recovering from checkpoints. The work-around is to
          either increase Carpet::prolongation_order_time or decrease the number of timelevels for
          the grid function in question accordingly.</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>

        <h4>Machine notes</h4>


        <p>
        </p>


        <ul>
          <li>Kraken<br>
          defs.local.ini needs to have sourcebasedir = $HOME configured for this machine. You need
          to determine $HOME by logging in to the machine.</li>


          <li>LoneStar and Ranger<br>
          defs.local.ini needs to have sourcebasedir = $WORK and basedir = $SCRATCH/simulations
          configured for this machine. You need to determine $WORK and $SCRATCH by logging in to
          the machine.</li>


          <li>Pandora<br>
          The LSU system Pandora has at the time of writing not only severe problems of compiling
          Cactus (can crash the filesystem), but in part due to this also outstanding are some
          failing testsuite results. Please contact Peter Diener at CCT (LSU) before trying to use
          this machine.</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>

        <p>All repositories participating in this release carry a branch ET_2012_05
        marking this release. These release branches will be updated if severe errors are
        found.</p>
