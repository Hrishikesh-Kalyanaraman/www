        <h1>Release Announcement</h1>


        <p>We are pleased to announce the thirteenth release (code name "<a href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tycho_Brahe">Brahe</a>") of the Einstein Toolkit, an open,
        community developed software infrastructure for relativistic astrophysics. This release
        includes, among other things, updates to the IllinoisGRMHD code, updated requirements
        concerning C++, and updates examples in the gallery. In addition, bug fixes accumulated
        since the previous release in November 2015 have been included.</p>


        <p>The Einstein Toolkit is a collection of software components and tools for simulating and
        analyzing general relativistic astrophysical systems that builds on numerous software
        efforts in the numerical relativity community including CactusEinstein, the Carpet AMR
        infrastructure and the relativistic magneto-hydrodynamics code GRHydro. For parts of the
        toolkit, the Cactus Framework is used as the underlying computational infrastructure
        providing large-scale parallelization, general computational components, and a model for
        collaborative, portable code development. The toolkit includes modules to build complete
        codes for simulating black hole spacetimes as well as systems governed by relativistic
        magneto-hydrodynamics.</p>


        <p>The Einstein Toolkit uses a distributed software model and its different modules are
        developed, distributed, and supported either by the core team of Einstein Toolkit
        Maintainers, or by individual groups. Where modules are provided by external groups, the
        Einstein Toolkit Maintainers provide quality control for modules for inclusion in the
        toolkit and help coordinate support. The Einstein Toolkit Maintainers currently involve
        postdocs and faculty from six different institutions, and host weekly meetings that are
        open for anyone to join in.</p>


        <p>Guiding principles for the design and implementation of the toolkit include: open,
        community-driven software development; well thought out and stable interfaces; separation
        of physics software from computational science infrastructure; provision of complete
        working production code; training and education for a new generation of researchers.</p>


        <p>For more information about using or contributing to the Einstein Toolkit, or to join the
        Einstein Toolkit Consortium, please visit our web pages at &lt;<a href=
        "http://einsteintoolkit.org">http://einsteintoolkit.org</a>&gt;.</p>


        <p>The Einstein Toolkit is primarily supported by NSF 1212401/1212426/1212433/1212460
        (Einstein Toolkit), and also by 0905046/0941653 (PetaCactus) and 0710874 (LONI Grid).</p>


        <p>The Einstein Toolkit contains about 200 regression test cases. On a large portion of the
        tested machines, almost all of these test suites pass, using both MPI and OpenMP
        parallelization.</p>

          </li>
        </ul>


        <ul>

              Fortran.</li>


              <li>The 'checkout' target of 'make' has been removed, as it only supported cvs, was
              unused and untested for a long time.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>


          <li>IllinoisGRMHD/Convert_to_HydroBase: major update</li>


          <li>SetMask_SphericalSurface: modify criterion for setting the mask to avoid problems
          with intermittent apparent horizon finder failures</li>


          <li>More examples in the <a href="http://einsteintoolkit.org/about/gallery/">Einstein
          Toolkit Gallery</a>
          </li>


          <li>Simfactory

            <ul>
              <li>New configurations: acrcluster, centos, cori, minerva, sunnyvale</li>

          <li>New thorns or tools

            <ul>
              <li>New thorn WatchDog: a thorn that terminates jobs that do not make progress over a
              user-defined time frame, defined as time in between ANALYSIS steps.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>


        <ul>
          <li><b>How to upgrade from Somerville (ET_2015_11)</b>
          </li>
        </ul>


        <p>To upgrade from the previous release, use GetComponents with the new thornlist to check
        out the new version. Switching to the new branch is not possible for most repositories due
        to repository moves.</p>


        <p>See the <a href="http://einsteintoolkit.org/download/">Download</a> page on the Einstein
        Toolkit website for download instructions.</p>


        <ul>
          <li><b>Remaining issues with this release</b>
          </li>
        </ul>


        <ul>
          <li>Certain machines need to be configured specially in Simfactory because the remote
          directories cannot be determined automatically just from the user name. See the Machine
          notes below.</li>


          <li>Recovering with Carpet: Carpet stores metadata (such as the simulation time) only for
          Carpet::max_timelevels time levels, although it is possible to allocate more time levels.
          These additional time levels then cannot be recovered; the symptom is an assertion
          failure during recovery. The solution is to either increase Carpet::max_timelevels, or to
          decrease the number of active time levels.</li>
        </ul>


        <ul>
          <li><b>Machine notes</b>
          </li>
        </ul>


        <p>Supported (tested) machines include:</p>


        <ul>
          <li>Default Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, and MacOS installations</li>


          <li>Bethe</li>


          <li>Bluewaters</li>


          <li>Comet</li>


          <li>Datura</li>


          <li>Fionn</li>


          <li>Gordon</li>


          <li>GPC</li>


          <li>Gullimin</li>


          <li>MP2</li>


          <li>Nvidia</li>


          <li>Queenbee 2</li>


          <li>Shelob</li>


          <li>Supermike II</li>


          <li>Stampede (CPU)</li>


          <li>Titan</li>


          <li>Zwicky</li>
        </ul>


        <ul>
          <li>Stampede: defs.local.ini needs to have sourcebasedir = $WORK and basedir =
          $SCRATCH/simulations configured for this machine. You need to determine $WORK and
          $SCRATCH by logging in to the machine.</li>
        </ul>


        <p>All repositories participating in this release carry a branch ET_2016_05 marking this
        release. These release branches will be updated if severe errors are found.</p>
