        <h1>Release Announcement</h1>


        <p>We are pleased to announce the eleventh release (code name "<a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert">Hilbert</a>") of the Einstein Toolkit, an
        open, community developed software infrastructure for relativistic astrophysics. This
        release includes, among other things, various improvements in the handling of external
        libraries (and with that, installations), discontinue the direct support for Fortran 77
        (use Fortran 90 instead), and enable the C++ code in GRHydro by default. In addition, bug
        fixes accumulated since the previous release in November 2014 have been included.</p>


        <p>The Einstein Toolkit is a collection of software components and tools for simulating and
        analyzing general relativistic astrophysical systems that builds on numerous software
        efforts in the numerical relativity community including CactusEinstein, the Carpet AMR
        infrastructure and the relativistic magneto-hydrodynamics code GRHydro. The Cactus
        Framework is used as the underlying computational infrastructure providing large-scale
        parallelization, general computational components, and a model for collaborative, portable
        code development. The toolkit includes modules to build complete codes for simulating black
        hole spacetimes as well as systems governed by relativistic magneto-hydrodynamics.</p>


        <p>The Einstein Toolkit uses a distributed software model and its different modules are
        developed, distributed, and supported either by the core team of Einstein Toolkit
        Maintainers, or by individual groups. Where modules are provided by external groups, the
        Einstein Toolkit Maintainers provide quality control for modules for inclusion in the
        toolkit and help coordinate support. The Einstein Toolkit Maintainers currently involve
        postdocs and faculty from six different institutions, and host weekly meetings that are
        open for anyone to join in.</p>


        <p>Guiding principles for the design and implementation of the toolkit include: open,
        community-driven software development; well thought out and stable interfaces; separation
        of physics software from computational science infrastructure; provision of complete
        working production code; training and education for a new generation of researchers.</p>


        <p>For more information about using or contributing to the Einstein Toolkit, or to join the
        Einstein Toolkit Consortium, please visit our web pages at &lt;<a href=
        "http://einsteintoolkit.org">http://einsteintoolkit.org</a>&gt;.</p>


        <p>The Einstein Toolkit is primarily supported by NSF 1212401/1212426/1212433/1212460
        (Einstein Toolkit), and also by 0905046/0941653 (PetaCactus) and 0710874 (LONI Grid).</p>


        <p>The Einstein Toolkit contains about 200 regression test cases. On a large portion of the
        tested machines, almost all of these test suites pass, using both MPI and OpenMP
        parallelization.</p>


        <h4>The changes between this and the previous release include:</h4>


        <ul>
          <li><b>Larger changes since last release</b>
          </li>
        </ul>


        <ul>
          <li>New components:

            <ul>
              <li>CactusExamples/Poisson</li>


              <li>CactusNumerical/LocalInterp2: a C++ drop-in replacement for LocalInterp</li>


              <li>CactusNumerical/TestLocalInterp2: containing tests for LocalInterp2</li>


              <li>CactusUtils/SystemTopology: Utility thorn</li>
            </ul>
          </li>


          <li>Moved components:

            <ul>
              <li>McLachlan moved to Bitbucket</li>
            </ul>
          </li>


          <li>Simfactory

            <ul>
              <li>Updates to many machines and some new machines</li>


              <li>Mac OS: Optionlists have been updated and simplified. There is now
              osx-macports.cfg and osc-homebrew.cfg which should work on OS X 10.8, 10.9 and 10.10.
              MacPorts updated to use GCC 4.9 to match Homebrew. Both optionlists contain comments
              with the necessary "port" and "brew" commands to install the expected packages. For
              MacPorts, you also need the osx-macports.run runscript.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>


          <li>GRHydro

            <ul>
              <li>Enable C++ code by default, Fortran code still present, but deprecated.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>


          <li>External Libraries

            <ul>
              <li>Delay build of external libraries so they can be 'made' in parallel.</li>


              <li>Several updates to accommodate changes in system library paths, and update some
              built versions of libraries.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>


          <li>Cactus:

            <ul>
              <li>Change default output filename format from implementation::groupname to
              implementation-groupname (parameter IOUtil::out_group_separator).</li>


              <li>'make' (without configuration name) works now, as long as there is only one
              configuration present.</li>


              <li>Piraha replaced parts of the old Cactus parser (but that should not be a user
              visible change).</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>


        <ul>
          <li><b>How to upgrade from Wheeler (ET_2014_11)</b>
          </li>
        </ul>


        <p>To upgrade from the previous release, use GetComponents with the new thornlist to check
        out the new version. Switching to the new branch is not possible for most repositories due
        to the repository move.</p>


        <p>See the <a href="http://einsteintoolkit.org/download/">Download</a> page on the Einstein
        Toolkit website for download instructions.</p>


        <ul>
          <li><b>Remaining issues with this release</b>
          </li>
        </ul>


        <ul>
          <li>Certain machines need to be configured specially in Simfactory because the remote
          directories cannot be determined automatically just from the user name. See the Machine
          notes below.</li>


          <li>Recovering with Carpet: Carpet stores metadata (such as the simulation time) only for
          Carpet::max_timelevels time levels, although it is possible to allocate more time levels.
          These additional time levels then cannot be recovered; the symptom is an assertion
          failure during recovery. The solution is to either increase Carpet::max_timelevels, or to
          decrease the number of active time levels.</li>
        </ul>


        <ul>
          <li><b>Machine notes</b>
          </li>
        </ul>


        <p>Supported (tested) machines include:</p>


        <ul>
          <li>Default Debian, Fedora and MacOS installations</li>


          <li>Bluewaters *</li>


          <li>Carver</li>


          <li>Comet</li>


          <li>Datura</li>


          <li>Edison</li>


          <li>Fermi</li>


          <li>Galileo</li>


          <li>Hopper</li>


          <li>Loewe</li>


          <li>Supermike II</li>


          <li>Nvidia</li>


          <li>Orca *</li>


          <li>Philip</li>


          <li>Queenbee 2</li>


          <li>Shelob</li>


          <li>Stampede (CPU)</li>


          <li>Zwicky</li>
        </ul>


        <p>A * means that a small number of tests fail on that machine. Almost all tests pass on
        the other machines.</p>


        <ul>
          <li>Stampede: defs.local.ini needs to have sourcebasedir = $WORK and basedir =
          $SCRATCH/simulations configured for this machine. You need to determine $WORK and
          $SCRATCH by logging in to the machine.</li>
        </ul>


        <p>All repositories participating in this release carry a branch ET_2015_05 marking this
        release. These release branches will be updated if severe errors are found.</p>
