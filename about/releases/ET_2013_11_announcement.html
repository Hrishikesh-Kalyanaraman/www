        <h1>Release Announcement</h1>

        <p>We are pleased to announce the eighth release (code name "<a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Noether">Noether</a>") of the Einstein Toolkit, an open,
        community developed software infrastructure for relativistic astrophysics. This release
        includes various improvements to the Cactus flesh, Carpet and GRHydro. In addition, bug
        fixes accumulated since the previous release in May 2013 have been included.</p>


        <p>The Einstein Toolkit is a collection of software components and tools for simulating and
        analyzing general relativistic astrophysical systems that builds on numerous software
        efforts in the numerical relativity community including CactusEinstein, the Carpet AMR
        infrastructure and the relativistic magneto-hydrodynamics code GRHydro. The Cactus
        Framework is used as the underlying computational infrastructure providing large-scale
        parallelization, general computational components, and a model for collaborative, portable
        code development. The toolkit includes modules to build complete codes for simulating black
        hole spacetimes as well as systems governed by relativistic magneto-hydrodynamics.</p>


        <p>The Einstein Toolkit uses a distributed software model and its different modules are
        developed, distributed, and supported either by the core team of Einstein Toolkit
        Maintainers, or by individual groups. Where modules are provided by external groups, the
        Einstein Toolkit Maintainers provide quality control for modules for inclusion in the
        toolkit and help coordinate support. The Einstein Toolkit Maintainers currently involve
        postdocs and faculty from six different institutions, and host weekly meetings that are
        open for anyone to join in.</p>


        <p>Guiding principles for the design and implementation of the toolkit include: open,
        community-driven software development; well thought out and stable interfaces; separation
        of physics software from computational science infrastructure; provision of complete
        working production code; training and education for a new generation of researchers.</p>


        <p>For more information about using or contributing to the Einstein Toolkit, or to join the
        Einstein Toolkit Consortium, please visit our web pages at &lt;<a href=
        "http://einsteintoolkit.org">http://einsteintoolkit.org</a>&gt;.</p>


        <p>The Einstein Toolkit is primarily supported by NSF 1212401/1212426/1212433/1212460
        (Einstein Toolkit), and also by 0905046/0941653 (PetaCactus) and 0710874 (LONI Grid).</p>


        <p>The Einstein Toolkit contains about 200 regression test cases. On a large portion of the
        tested machines, almost all of these testsuites pass, using both MPI and OpenMP
        parallelization.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Remaining issues with this release</b>
          </li>
        </ul>


        <p>
        </p>


        <ul>
          <li>Certain machines need to be configured specially in Simfactory because the remote
          directories cannot be determined automatically just from the username. See the Machine
          notes below. * Recovering with Carpet: Carpet stores metadata (such as the simulation
          time) only for Carpet::max_timelevels time levels, although it is possible to allocate
          more time levels. These additional time levels then cannot be recovered; the symptom is
          an assertion failure during recovery. The solution is to either increase
          Carpet::max_timelevels, or to decrease the number of active time levels.</li>


          <li>Some versions of the Intel compiler (so far, all past 20121010 that we have seen)
          produce wrong code for some valid constructs present in the toolkit. Disabling the
          'restrict' keyword works around this issue, and is now used for these compilers until
          they are fixed, this potentially reduces performance. This bug has been reported to
          Intel.</li>

          machine. You need to determine $HOME by logging in to the machine.</li>


          <li>LoneStar and Stampede: defs.local.ini needs to have sourcebasedir = $WORK and basedir
          = $SCRATCH/simulations configured for this machine. You need to determine $WORK and
