        <h2>Release Announcement</h2>


        <p>We are pleased to announce the second release (code name "<a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subrahmanyan_Chandrasekhar">Chandrasekhar</a>") of the
        Einstein Toolkit, an open, community developed software infrastructure for relativistic
        astrophysics. This release is mainly a maintenance release incorporating fixes accumulated
        since the previous release in June 2010, as well as additional test suites.</p>


        <p>The Einstein Toolkit is a collection of software components and tools for simulating and
        analyzing general relativistic astrophysical systems that builds on numerous software
        efforts in the numerical relativity community including CactusEinstein, the Carpet AMR
        infrastructure and on the public version of the Whisky hydrodynamics code (now modified and
        called GRHydro). The Cactus Framework is used as the underlying computational
        infrastructure providing large-scale parallelization, general computational components, and
        a model for collaborative, portable code development. The toolkit includes modules to build
        complete codes for simulating black hole spacetimes as well as systems governed by
        relativistic hydrodynamics. Current development in the consortium is targeted at providing
        additional infrastructure for general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics.</p>


        <p>The Einstein Toolkit uses a distributed software model and its different modules are
        developed, distributed, and supported either by the core team of Einstein Toolkit
        Maintainers, or by individual groups. Where modules are provided by external groups, the
        Einstein Toolkit Maintainers provide quality control for modules for inclusion in the
        toolkit and help coordinate support. The Einstein Toolkit Maintainers currently involve
        postdocs and faculty from five different institutions, and host weekly meetings that are
        open for anyone to join in.</p>


        <p>Guiding principles for the design and implementation of the toolkit include: open,
        community-driven software development; well thought out and stable interfaces; separation
        of physics software from computational science infrastructure; provision of complete
        working production code; training and education for a new generation of researchers.</p>


        <p>For more information about using or contributing to the Einstein Toolkit, or to join the
        Einstein Toolkit Consortium, please visit our web pages at &lt;<a href=
        "http://einsteintoolkit.org">http://einsteintoolkit.org</a>&gt;.</p>


        <p>The Einstein Toolkit is primarily supported by NSF 0903973/0903782/0904015 (CIGR), and
        also by NSF 0701566/0855892 (XiRel), 0721915 (Alpaca), 0905046/0941653 (PetaCactus) and
        0710874 (LONI Grid).</p>


        <p>This release comprises the following tools, arrangements, and thorns. Each
        tool/arrangement/thorn may have its own licencing conditions, but all are available as open
        source. Green components are new in this release, shown in red are components now not
        longer part of the Einstein Toolkit:</p>

        <p>All repositories participating in this release carry a branch ET_2010_11
        marking this release. These release branches will be updated if severe errors are
        found.</p>

        <p>The <a href="http://www.cct.lsu.edu/~eschnett/SimFactory/">Simulation Factory</a>
        contains ready-to-use configuration details for more than 20 additional systems, including
        most HPC systems at <a href="http://www.loni.org/">LONI</a>, <a href=
        "http://www.nersc.gov/">NERSC</a>, <a href="http://www.rzg.mpg.de/">RZG</a>, and <a href=
        "https://www.teragrid.org/">TeraGrid</a>.</p>


        <p>The Einstein Toolkit thorns contain 132 regression test cases. While all test cases pass
        on some systems, there are unfortunately also some systems where certain test cases fail.
        We verified that this is because of accumulation of floating-point round-off error in most
        cases, and we will discuss this issue in a broader context in the near future.</p>


        <p>The Einstein Toolkit web site contains online documentation for its thorns, and pointers
        for using it to build your own code. There is also a tutorial that explains how to
        download, build, and run the code for a simple binary black hole evolution. We invite you
        to join our mailing list &lt;<a href="../../support.html">users@einsteintoolkit.org</a>&gt;.</p>
        The changes between this and the previous release include (not complete):

        <ul>
          <li>Several Libraries can now be build in parallel-make mode, increasing compilation
          speed on some machines a lot.</li>


          <li>Several Libraries now clean up intermediate files, often using considerably less disk
          space per configuration.</li>


          <li>GRHydro includes (disabled, not yet finished) support for MHD. Don't try to use it
          yet, and don't get confused about that code.</li>


          <li>Several Libraries have been updated (ExternalLibraries)</li>


          <li>Simfactory received several updates, and this will likely be the last release with
          the Perl version.</li>


          <li>The links in the Reference manual now work (again).</li>


          <li>A lot of other bugs and testsuites were corrected.</li>
        </ul>
