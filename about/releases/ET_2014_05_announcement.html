        <h1>Release Announcement</h1>
        <p>We are pleased to announce the ninth release (code name "<a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Archibald_Wheeler">Wheeler</a>") of the Einstein
        Toolkit, an open, community developed software infrastructure for relativistic
        astrophysics. This release includes various improvements to the Cactus flesh, Carpet and
        GRHydro. In addition, bug fixes accumulated since the previous release in November 2013
        have been included.</p>


        <p>The Einstein Toolkit is a collection of software components and tools for simulating and
        analyzing general relativistic astrophysical systems that builds on numerous software
        efforts in the numerical relativity community including CactusEinstein, the Carpet AMR
        infrastructure and the relativistic magneto-hydrodynamics code GRHydro. The Cactus
        Framework is used as the underlying computational infrastructure providing large-scale
        parallelization, general computational components, and a model for collaborative, portable
        code development. The toolkit includes modules to build complete codes for simulating black
        hole spacetimes as well as systems governed by relativistic magneto-hydrodynamics.</p>


        <p>The Einstein Toolkit uses a distributed software model and its different modules are
        developed, distributed, and supported either by the core team of Einstein Toolkit
        Maintainers, or by individual groups. Where modules are provided by external groups, the
        Einstein Toolkit Maintainers provide quality control for modules for inclusion in the
        toolkit and help coordinate support. The Einstein Toolkit Maintainers currently involve
        postdocs and faculty from six different institutions, and host weekly meetings that are
        open for anyone to join in.</p>


        <p>Guiding principles for the design and implementation of the toolkit include: open,
        community-driven software development; well thought out and stable interfaces; separation
        of physics software from computational science infrastructure; provision of complete
        working production code; training and education for a new generation of researchers.</p>


        <p>For more information about using or contributing to the Einstein Toolkit, or to join the
        Einstein Toolkit Consortium, please visit our web pages at &lt;<a href=
        "http://einsteintoolkit.org">http://einsteintoolkit.org</a>&gt;.</p>


        <p>The Einstein Toolkit is primarily supported by NSF 1212401/1212426/1212433/1212460
        (Einstein Toolkit), and also by 0905046/0941653 (PetaCactus) and 0710874 (LONI Grid).</p>


        <p>The Einstein Toolkit contains about 200 regression test cases. On a large portion of the
        tested machines, almost all of these test suites pass, using both MPI and OpenMP
        parallelization.</p>

          <li><b>How to upgrade from Noether (ET_2013_11)</b>
          </li>
        </ul>


        <p>To upgrade from the previous release, use GetComponents with the new thornlist to check
        out the new version.</p>


        <p>See the <a href="http://einsteintoolkit.org/download/">Download</a> page on the Einstein
        Toolkit website for download instructions.</p>


        <ul>
          <li><b>Remaining issues with this release</b>
          </li>
        </ul>


        <ul>
          <li>Certain machines need to be configured specially in Simfactory because the remote
          directories cannot be determined automatically just from the user name. See the Machine
          notes below.</li>


          <li>Recovering with Carpet: Carpet stores metadata (such as the simulation time) only for
          Carpet::max_timelevels time levels, although it is possible to allocate more time levels.
          These additional time levels then cannot be recovered; the symptom is an assertion
          failure during recovery. The solution is to either increase Carpet::max_timelevels, or to
          decrease the number of active time levels.</li>
        </ul>


        <ul>
          <li><b>Machine notes</b>
          </li>
        </ul>


        <p>Supported (tested) machines include:</p>


        <ul>
          <li>Default Debian, Suse and Fedora installations</li>


          <li>Bethe</li>


          <li>Bluewaters *</li>


          <li>Carver</li>


          <li>Datura</li>


          <li>Gordon</li>


          <li>Hopper</li>


          <li>Loewe</li>


          <li>Lonestar *</li>


          <li>Supermike II</li>


          <li>Nvidia *</li>


          <li>Orca *</li>


          <li>Philip</li>


          <li>Queenbee</li>


          <li>Shelob</li>


          <li>Stampede (CPU)</li>


          <li>Supermuc</li>


          <li>Titan</li>


          <li>Trestles</li>


          <li>Zwicky</li>
        </ul>


        <p>A * means that a small number of tests still fail on that machine. All tests pass on the
        other machines.</p>


        <ul>
          <li>LoneStar and Stampede: defs.local.ini needs to have sourcebasedir = $WORK and basedir
          = $SCRATCH/simulations configured for this machine. You need to determine $WORK and
          $SCRATCH by logging in to the machine.</li>
        </ul>


        <p>All repositories participating in this release carry a branch ET_2014_05 marking this
        release. These release branches will be updated if severe errors are found.</p>
