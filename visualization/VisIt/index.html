<h3>What is VisIt?</h3>

<p>
VisIt is a state-of-the-art data visualization tool based on the open source 
visualization class-library VTK and is developed and maintained at the Lawrence 
Livermore National Laboratory, University of California. VisIt is a uniquely 
powerful, full-featured software package for the visualization of scientific, 
engineering and analytical data: Its open system design is built on a standard 
interface environment. And its sophisticated data model provides users with 
great flexibility in creating visualizations.
</p><p>
The official <a href="https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/visit/">VisIt home page</a>
should be visited to 
get general information about VisIt. There are links to a "Getting Started" 
introduction into VisIt, a gallery of VisIt visualization examples, a user and 
developer discussion forum, FAQs, support contacts, and much more.
</p><p>
In contrast to the visualization package OpenDX, VisIt does not offer a data 
flow-based programming environment. Instead, plots are generated by creating 
"plot objects" from variables contained in a data file and adding modifiers to 
the corresponding plot stack. In this way, sophisticated visualizations 
including complicated data transformations can be created within a few 
mouse-clicks making it the software of choice for quick and efficient data 
inspection. In addition, parallel rendering with multiple processor cores 
enables for the processing of hugh datasets. Various features include
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Import and Export of a large number of different data formats</li>
 <li>Data Transformation / Expressions</li>
 <li>High-end rendering</li>
 <li>Graphics output</li>
 <li>Full parallel support</li>
 <li>Online visualization</li>
 <li>Debugging</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p>
A wide number of functional modules for each of the above categories is already 
built into the VisIt server program as provided with the standard distribution 
of VisIt. Developers can also add their own, specialized functionality as 
external plugins to link against the VisIt runtime libraries. We are using this 
mechanism to provide our own database plugins to read datafiles written in our 
customized HDF5 format. WaveToy 3D Volume-rendering Visualization 2D

<h2>Remote Visualisation</h2>

<p>
VisIt supports remote visualisation, where the client runs locally,
but the data are stored on a remote machine.
</p><p>
Remote visualisation requires ssh access from the local to the remote
machine.  In addition, the "visit" command must be in the path
on the remote machine.  You may need to edit your <t>.profile</t> file on the remote machine.
</p><p>
In order to set up remote visualisation, one needs to add a "host
profile" for the remote machine; see the menu entry "Options/Host
profiles...".  Here is my host profile for numrel02.cct.lsu.edu:
</p>

<p>
 I have also enabled ssh tunnelling.  ssh tunnelling is useful if you want to access data while you are travelling and need to go through a firewall.  ssh tunnelling is probably slower than using direct access.
</p>

<p>
<a href="visitscreenshot2.jpg"><img border=0 align="center" width="400" src="visitscreenshot2.jpg" alt="VisIt Visualization"></a>
</p><p>
Remote files are accessed in the "File/Open file..." dialog by
choosing the corresponding host: 
</p><p>
<a href="visitscreenshot3.jpg"><img border=0 align="center" width="400" src="visitscreenshot3.jpg" alt="VisIt Visualization"></a>
</p>

<p>
Notice that the environment variable $VISITSSH controls which executable VisIt invokes
to log into the remote machine; this is particularly useful if the remote machine is not
accessible via ssh, but uses, e.g., Globus tools such as gsissh. Sometimes such passwordless
logins also require VisIt to not try and mediate between the user and the shell, which can 
be obtained with the command-line flag -nopty. 
</p>


<h2>The CarpetHDF5 package</h2>
<p>
Starting with VisIt version 2.5
datafiles written in the HDF5 file format (as created by various I/O methods in 
Cactus) can be read by the built-in VisIt database plugins. 

Older versions of VisIt do not yet include the database plugin. For that
reason appropriate readers must be provided as external database plugins.
This is also required if the very newest version of the reader is needed.
</p><p>
The CarpetHDF5 package provides such readers as runtime-loadable plugins to 
be used in a standard installation of VisIt.
</p><p>
<tt>CarpetHDF5</tt> reads arbitrary N-dimensional datasets from (parallel) HDF5 output
      generated by the <a href="http://www.carpetcode.org/">Carpet</a> adaptive
      mesh-refinement (AMR) driver for Cactus.
      The datasets in the HDF5 datafile are assumed to describe Carpet-AMR data,
      i.e., one or multiple regular nested grids with different resolutions.
      Since in parallel runs one usualy deals with chunked HDF5 files, the
      reader is capable of transparent recombination on-the-fly.
</p>
<h3>Downloading and Installing</h3>
<p>
For obtaining VisIt you can go to the VisIt 
<a href="https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/visit/downloads">download page</a> 
which provides pre-compiled binaries 
for a number of architectures. If your architecture is not among these, or the 
binary distribution doesn't work for you, you can also download the sources and 
build VisIt yourself. Please read the README and INSTALL files in the source 
distribution and follow the instructions given therein.
</p><p>
The CarpetHDF5 package can be obtained from the Cactus Subversion server via 
anonymous checkout:
</p>
<code>
  svn co https://svn.cactuscode.org/VizTools/CarpetHDF5/trunk/ CarpetHDF5
</code>
<p>
In order to build the CarpetHDF5 plugin you need to have a 
standard distribution of VisIt already installed on your system.
To install the package, simply execute the install script contained in the 
CarpetHDF5 package. If VisIt was properly installed, a window will pop-up. 
In the "CMake"-tab modify the library and include path for the HDF5-library 
which is included in the Visit installation. For example:
</p>
<code>
  CXXFLAGS: -I/path_to_visit/2.5.0/linux-x86_64/include/hdf5/include
  LDFLAGS: -L/path_to_visit/2.5.0/linux-x86_64/lib
  LIBS: -lhdf5
</code>
<p>
Then go to the "File"-menu, save the 
file and close the window. The plugin will then be generated and installed.
</p><p>
Note that there may be a problem if several plugins support HDF5
files.  In this case, it can happen that the wrong plugin in chosen to
open a file, even if the correct plugin is selected in the "open file"
dialogue.  As a work-around, you can remove all other HDF5-based
plugins, such as e.g. the PIXIE plugin; alternatively, the command-line
flag "-assume_format CarpetHDF5" passed to VisIt ensures that all
HDF5 files are opened with this plugin.
</p><p>
There is a known problem with some of the 2.5.0 binaries. When trying to
compile CarpetHDF5 with this, errors about VISIT_PLUGIN_TARGET_RTOD not being
defined appear. You can correct this by applying the following patch
to your visit installation and then retry to compile the CarpetHDF5 plugin:
