          <p>The Einstein Toolkit is comprised of a core set of software components whose development and support is overseen by the Einstein Toolkit Maintainers. Additional components
          are developed and supported by individuals and groups in coordination with the maintainers. The Maintainers mandate is to:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><i>Oversee the architecture of the Einstein Toolkit.</i></li>
            <li><i>Ensure software quality and verification across the Einstein Toolkit.</i></li>
            <li><i>Oversee the inclusion of software components in the Einstein Toolkit. This includes new software components to be developed in the Consortium as part of<br>
            the core Einstein Toolkit and the vetting of software contributed as external components.</i></li>
            <li><i>Ensure that appropriate individuals have privileges to check software into the EinsteinToolkit.org repository.</i></li>
          </ol>
          <p>The Einstein Toolkit Maintainers can be contacted at <a href="mailto:maintainers@einteintoolkit.org">maintainers@einsteintoolkit.org</a>, the maintainers are:</p><br>
